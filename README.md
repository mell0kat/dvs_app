## Why do you feel suitable for this role?
I've had "data visualization" in my work title for about a year, but it was not until stumbling upon the DVS 4 weeks ago that my eyes were really opened to the Data Viz World.

And what a whirlwind adventure it's been thus far!  From a fifty (and counting!) message-long thread on "bullet journals" to the recent merch offering (yeah I'll be sporting some fresh socks very soon!), DVS has already proven itself to be an awesome source of data viz community and content.

I try not to use the word passion (I find it overused, like _literally_) but lately I've certainly been feeling inspired, curious, and motivated (like _took-the-M-instead-of-the-F-and-ended-up-in-Bushwick-instead-of-Park-Slope-because-I-was-totally-absorbed-by-Ally-Torbandâ€™s-Data-Viz-Today-podcast_ motivated).

#### What can I offer?
* Beginners perspective / fresh eyes â€” I'm not afraid to be the voice of eagerness and naivetÃ© (and to say that my first d3 project was an [animated pie chart](https://mell0kat.github.io/d3_pie_chart_cell_phone_data/) ðŸ˜® )
* Willingness to help out however I can â€” Iâ€™m intrigued by the mystery and potential underlying the phrase "ad hoc tasks as needed"
* Python and JavaScript skills â€” my past 3 years of Fullstack dev have prepared me well to help out with any coding needs!

I'd love to give back to the welcoming community that has already done so much for me!

#### A note on my data Viz portfolio:
Most of my Data Viz work so far has been in my current role so I don't have much to share (yet!), but I can point to [this piece](https://observablehq.com/@mell0kat/katherine-uses-trigonometry-for-the-first-time-in-years) where I explain a little d3 exercise and [this piece](https://medium.com/front-end-weekly/takeaways-from-our-latest-react-native-project-99d2d619ff99) (featured on Front End weekly) where I discuss some learnings from a React Native project.

## What would you like to get done in this role over the next year?
Iâ€™d like to be the voice of Data Viz newbies and to contribute to the DVS however I can be most impactful.
